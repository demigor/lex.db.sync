##Lex.DB.Sync FrameworkLex.DB.Sync is a lightweight data synchronization framework for OData (WCF Data Services) endpoints. ###Why?In addition to database engine [Lex.DB](https://github.com/demigor/lex.db), simple, small and fast data synchronization framework is what most of us needed for disconnected applications. Imagine, that all your data is loaded only once; consequent synchronization requests will deliver only changed records. Forget about permanent connection to the server, leave it do terminal-like HTML application. You just need split second to have all your data up-to-date, locally, literally on your fingertips.###Supported platforms:* .NET 4.0+, * Silverlight 5.0+, * Windows Phone 8.0+, * Windows RT+.Check [author blog ](http://lexblog.azurewebsites.net)for more information about Lex.DB.Sync.
